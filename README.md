# Neuro Fuzzy Algorithm

Neuro fuzzy algorithm development

Its a combination of the fuzzy controller and two learning algorithms, the learning set algorithm and the rule learning 
algorithm. These learning procedures are not the normal learning procedures from neural networks, here an analogy to the 
backpropagation algorithm is exposed.
